    <h2>About the Fries</h2>
    <p>
        Green Valley Grills truffle fries are a Greensboro tradition and are one of the most popular features 
        <br>on our menu (second only to GVGs parmesan crusted chicken). Below you’ll find the recipe to make 
        <br>these delicious fries at home.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups Idaho Russet Potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tsp Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (2 fl oz) Parmesan Lime Aioli (see recipe below)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsps. (1 oz) Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
            <li>1 Tbsps. (½ oz) Black Truffle Oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp Truffled Sea Salt</li>
            <li>2 cups Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 fl oz Lime Juice</li>
            <li>½ cup Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
            <li>¼ tsp chopped fresh Thyme</li>
            <li>½ tbsp chopped fresh Garlic</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill large bowl ½ way with cold water. Slice potatoes into 1/4 to 3/8 inch strips. Place cut potatoes directly into cold water. 
                <br>Agitate potatoes to remove dirt and excess starch. Put aside. To make a salt water bath, fill a second large bowl 1/4 way with warm water, 
                <br>add Kosher Salt, stir to dissolve. Add ¼ way with cold water. Transfer potatoes from first bowl to salted water bath. Potatoes can be 
                <br>stored in the refrigerator until you are ready to blanch.</li>
            <li>Heat fry oil in fryer to 300 degrees. Shake excess water from potatoes and place in fry basket in batches. Drop into oil and allow to cook for 
                <br>2 minutes and 15 seconds. Remove from oil and shake aggressively to separate fries. Place cooked fries on a sheet tray and keep cold until ready 
                <br>for final cooking step. Wait for fry oil temperature to return to 300 degrees before continuing with next batch.</li>
            <li>Yields 7 pounds blanched potatoes</li>
            <li>Place 1 1/2 cups (12 oz) of blanched potatoes in hot fryer until crisp. Drain well. Place fries in a metal mixing bowl and toss with grated cheese, 
                <br>truffle oil and salt. Enjoy and dip in Parmesan Lime Aioli.</li>
        </ol>
